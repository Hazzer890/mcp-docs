## Laboratory 3: Serial Printing, Interrupts and Button Debounce

### Lab Briefing

During this lab you will be using interrupts to read button presses and print to serial how many have been detected.

To transmit data from the microcontroller to the computer a communication protocol needs to be initiated. Provided in the MCP repo is a serial library which communicates using USART on channel 0 with BAUD 9600.

The *serial0_print_string()* function prints a string to serial which can be viewed using VScodes inbuilt serial monitor. String literals can be sent accross using this function. To send variables using this command they must first be formatted into strings, see *springf*

In the previous lab we used digital input using the *PINx* register which holds the current value of the input pins. To use this to trigger some code the register must be constantly polled, another method of triggering code is to use an interrupt instead.

Hardware interrupts allow for functions to be executed by external voltage inputs and can be configured using the external interrupt control registers page 110 of the [datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-2549-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561_datasheet.pdf)

When the push button is pressed an released the voltage does not transition from low to high in one step there is *bouncing* which occurs which makes it appear like the button is being pressed multiple times.

To avoid the interrupts being triggered multiple times from a single button press a form of button debounce needs to be implemented, either in software or hardware.

**TASK 1**

Drive a 12 volt lamp using a transistor to blink it on and off a couple of times a second, without having any risk of damaging the microcontroller.

**TASK 2**

Drive a DC motor using a darlington driver, with flyback diode, turning it on and off using a push button connected to a hardware interrupt pin.

### Before the lab

- **Review string formatting in c, suggest using sprintf [reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/fprintf)**
- **Read up on button-bounce, and consider ways of eliminating this problem - information here http://www.ganssle.com/debouncing-pt2.htm.**
- **Learn how to configure and use interrupts in AVR GCC. These **tutorials** These tutorials are a good resource: http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/AVRArticles.php**

### Outcomes

1. Draw relevant circuit diagrams: One diagram for an output driver circuit using the 2N3904 transistor controlling the 12 volt lamp, one diagram for the darlington driver and flyback diode controlling the motor.
2. Demonstrate a functional and safe circuit (see datasheets to ensure safe currents) which blinks a 12 volt lamp using a transistor.
3. Demonstrate a push button being used to toggle the state of the 12 volt lamp using an interrupt
4. Demonstrate a 12 volt DC motor being controlled via darlington driver, with a debounced interrupt driven push button.
   - Show the circuit to a lab demonstrator prior to powering the circuit.
5. Describe the function of the flyback diode in the darlington driver and motor circuit. Explain what happens to the current flow when the motor is switched off (with and without the flyback diode)


**Tips**

Note on volatile variable type.

The compiler optimsises code to use the same value rather than reading the variables value if it does not see change in the value.
For variables modified in interrupts since this modification is not visible variable access within the main function their value will not be updated.
Declaring a variable as volatile tells the compiler that the variables value is prone to change externally and to always read the variable to check its value.
