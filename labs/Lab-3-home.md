# Mechatronic Microcontroller Project MXEN2003

## Laboratory 3 at home task:

This is an extension of lab 2 and 3 and will form a part of your final project.

This task will also require you to use and define functions and arrays and learn how to format these in C.

**Task**

Create a function that will take take an adc value or channel and return the mean of the last 10 values given to it. Use this to print to serial the voltage of the photoresistor averaged over the last second.

This will form a foundation for the light sensing system you will use in the final project to navigate between beacons.
