# Mechatronic Microcontroller Project MXEN2003

## Laboratory 4 at home task:

This is an extension of lab 4 and will useful in future labs and your final project.

This task will require you to gather data and use data linearization and compare to the datasheet.

**Task**

Create a function that will return the distance from the range sensor. 
  - This will require gathering data and calibrating the sensors using data linearization.
  - Compare the results with the datasheet to see how the sensor compares to the manufacturers specifications.
